# JavaScript Projects

This repository contains all JavaScript coding assignments, projects, and exercises completed throughout my course.

It serves as a portfolio of my progress, demonstrating my understanding of JavaScript concepts, problem-solving skills, and application development.

All projects will be regularly updated and maintained throughout the course.
